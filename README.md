This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in JavaScript related to type coercion. The `foo` function attempts to add a number and a string. JavaScript's loose typing allows this, but it results in string concatenation rather than numerical addition.  The solution provides a simple fix to ensure that both arguments are numbers before performing the addition. This highlights the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript.
